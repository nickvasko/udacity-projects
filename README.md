# udacity-projects
This is a repository of projects completed through Udacity nanodegrees, including the Deep Learning nanodegree (2018) and the Natural Language Processing nanodegree (2020). Each folder contains a different project with associated files. Below are descriptions of each of the projects.

**GANs_face_recognition -** Utilizes Deep Generative Adversial Network to generate synthetic images of hand-written digits and faces. Two publicly available datasets are used for training, MNIST (hand-written digits) and CelebA (human faces).

**simple_nn_nike_rental_prediction -** This project uses a simple Neural Network to predict hourly bike rental usage based on publicly available data.
